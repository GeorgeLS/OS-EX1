# OS-EX1
My first exercise in Operating Systems in UOA. It's a simulation of a component production line with 8 processes.
For the IPC method we have shared memory and the synchronization is achieved with semaphores.
To compile use the makefile.
To run the simulation, execute the program providing a command line argument which is the number of components to be created
by each of the component creator processes.
